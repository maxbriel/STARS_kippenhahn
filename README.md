# STARS_kippenhahn
Basic kippenhahn plotter for STARS


Run like this:
```
python kippenhahn.py 'image' 'plot_file'
```
where `image` is the output image name and `plot_file` the input plot file.

This is not perfect and can miss small regions.
Furthermore, it ignores boundaries less than 0.1 Msol apart.
